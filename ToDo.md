## Unity Event Functions

## ```GetComponent<T>()```

<!-- TODO -->

## ```Instantiate<T>()```

Well, everyone knows that it is a bad idea to abuse that function. Just make sure you don't do as well this. *Yes, I saw that many times, so don't make that expensive function take even more time for no reason, all of those can be other parameters of* ```Instantiate<T>()```.
```csharp
private void Whatever()
{
    for (int i = 0; i < YOUR_LIST.Count; ++i)
    {
        var component = Instantiate<YOUR_TYPE>(prefab); 
        component.transform.parent = transform;
        component.transform.position = Vector3.zero;
        // something else, mb rotation
    }
}
```

* [GameObject.SetA—Åtive(value) vs. Component.enabled = value](./Pages/SideBySideComparison/GOSetActiveVSComponentEnabled.md)




## ```.transform``` and ```.gameObject```

## Garbage Collection (GC)

### ```StringBuilder``` vs ```+``` vs ```string.Format(args)```/```$"{}"```
bla bla, string is not a struct, bla bla ```"str1" + "str2"``` just slower and maes gc
### ```.tag == someString``` vs 
### GC of yeild return new WaitForSeconds(value);
You can look at the talk on Unity forums where it is discussed. Sometimes I observe that looks roughly like this:

```csharp
protected System.Collections.IEnumerator DoSomeCoroutine()
{
    for (;;)
    {
        yield return new UnityEngine.WaitForEndOfFrame();
    }
}
```
which is not exactly the expected way of using Coroutines.



## Tags vs Layers vs Camera Depth

## Containers from ```System.Collections.Generics```


## Serialization

## Editor Scripts
### Editor
### PropertyDrawer

## Console Messages 

```csharp
Debug.LogFormat("<color=yellow>WARNING: {0} is </color>", someParameter);
```

## ```C#``` in Unity, compiling

## IDE
### Jetbrains Rider
Don't forget to use your IDE wisely rather than having all the things from the box. Learning your IDE requires roughly as much effort as Unity Editor, but you definetely save your time if wisely set up your work one.

```csharp
public class WhateverMB : MonoBehaviour
{
    // to make
    [SerializeField]
    protected Dropdown dropdown;

    // instead of
    [SerializeField] protected Dropdown dropdown;
}
