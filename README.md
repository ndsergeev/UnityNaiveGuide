# UnityNaiveGuide

## Preface

Probably the main question that you might have once reaching this page and seing lots of text which varies in quality: "Is it one more Unity Guide?"\
\- Yes. There are so many damn good resources on the web that sometimes it is difficult to find them all until you search for something very specific. I will put here all of those as well as some other tests I do in spare time (if I am even capable to compete with those bright minds who help improving my everydays code). I hope that set of practises here can be a good starting poing for someone. The text will have many alterations as long as I or other contributors learn new things about Unity.

I'd like to mention that not all the tests and recommendations can fit your project. **I belive that every line is written here makes you more suspicios, resulting in validating the information you are after on here** and then contributing to this guide with your clarifications. Highly appreciate this approach, so lets learn together!

It is important to mention that the tests that are provided in this guide should be considered quite sceptically. I believe that if you really want to compare two or more operations on which performance is better, then it is fair to compare on the level of instructions. However, I don't have the access to Unity's source code as well as I am not a specialist to go that deep to disassemble code. That is why all I can do is running some tests, which, sometimes, can be far from what you might face in production.

*PS, if you want to tell me at some point of reading that some of my examples are far-fetched and/or stupid, that they don't pass peer review in big teams â€“ I am very proud for your team and still sure that not all the teams are like yours!*
